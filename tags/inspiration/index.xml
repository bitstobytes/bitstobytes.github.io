      <description>It was January 2020. I had just returned from NCSS in Melbourne and had won a hackathon at the Academy of Entrepreneurs. The energy of the camps lingered on me and I was itching to do something, something big, exceptional and meaningful to me. Now, almost every bit of knowledge I have around programming came from online courses. When the topics were easy, I cruised through the tutorials, but when my code stopped working, it was truly frustrating to figure out what’s wrong.</description>

      <description>I first joined my schools F1 program in 2018 at the beginning of year 9. At the time I didn’t really know much the competition, and was only really joining to get an activity I could use for Duke of Ed. I already had a love for designing and making things and I thought making a mini race car sounded pretty cool. In my first year of competition I competed with a team called Quicksilver.</description>

      <description>The launch of the code club “Code Ninjas” founded by students Giuliana De Bellis and Edwina Adisusila in 2018 saw an exciting opportunity for extra-curricular computer programming at St Ursula’s College Kingsgrove.
Code Ninjas was first developed after Giuliana and Edwina attended the National Computer Science school in 2018. This camp inspired the girls to take their newfound passion and skills to the students at our school. Coming back from the camp, they brainstormed possible ways to get the college community involved in coding.</description>
