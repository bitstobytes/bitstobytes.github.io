      <description>I first joined my schools F1 program in 2018 at the beginning of year 9. At the time I didn’t really know much the competition, and was only really joining to get an activity I could use for Duke of Ed.

      <description>The launch of the code club “Code Ninjas” founded by students Giuliana De Bellis and Edwina Adisusila in 2018 saw an exciting opportunity for extra-curricular computer programming at St Ursula’s College Kingsgrove.
Code Ninjas was first developed after Giuliana and Edwina attended the National Computer Science school in 2018. This camp inspired the girls to take their newfound passion and skills to the students at our school. Coming back from the camp, they brainstormed possible ways to get the college community involved in coding.</description>
