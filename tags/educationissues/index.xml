      <description>I initially had no clue what to write about when starting this post.
So I figured I may as well think of why it is that I even like or got into programming in the first place.
The first thing that I realised that if it hadnâ€™t been for the computer lab that was set up and a passionate temp teacher in primary school starting a makeshift coding club at lunchtimes, I probably never would have had an interest in computers or coding, never would have decided to continue teaching myself once she left the school, never would have paid attention in year 7 technology classes, and most likely would not have chosen IST as a year 9 elective.</description>
