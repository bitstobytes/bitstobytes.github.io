      <description>It was January 2020. I had just returned from NCSS in Melbourne and had won a hackathon at the Academy of Entrepreneurs. The energy of the camps lingered on me and I was itching to do something, something big, exceptional and meaningful to me. Now, almost every bit of knowledge I have around programming came from online courses. When the topics were easy, I cruised through the tutorials, but when my code stopped working, it was truly frustrating to figure out whatâ€™s wrong.</description>

      <description>Hey, everyone!
Developing Bits to Bytes has been a jam-packed journey for me over the past couple of months. The team and I have iterated over the idea several times, putting in hours of effort into bringing it to life.
Now as I type up this first post, I find myself teeming with excitement at the possibilities of what Bits to Bytes can grow into.
A strong passion for science, technology, engineering and maths has inspired me to come up with this idea.</description>
