      <description>My love for stem came from meeting one of my best friends, Tom Day, back in 2016. He got me into computer programming.
This opened a whole lot of doors in opportunities for me, such as attending my first academic camp hosted by the National Computer Science School in 2019. Through this, I found a love for all things STEM! This camp was honestly one of the best experiences of my life.</description>

      <description>Throughout my early years of high school, I always intended to take either Biology or Chemistry as my science elective for the HSC. So when I wound up in a class studying Physics due to subject availability, I was not enthusiastic at all. I went in with many preconceptions about physics: that it was all about maths, that you needed to study engineering to understand the content, that my English-loving brain wouldnâ€™t be able to comprehend anything&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Hey, everyone!
Developing Bits to Bytes has been a jam-packed journey for me over the past couple of months. The team and I have iterated over the idea several times, putting in hours of effort into bringing it to life.
Now as I type up this first post, I find myself teeming with excitement at the possibilities of what Bits to Bytes can grow into.
A strong passion for science, technology, engineering and maths has inspired me to come up with this idea.</description>
