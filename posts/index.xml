      <title>A Seed Called VidUp</title>

      <description>When I first got into programming I was bewildered by the near infinite things one could accomplish through code. And like many people in the beginning, I struggled with the basic concepts. There was a strong sense of uncertainty within me at the time. I distinctly remember thinking, “Am I really cut out for coding? There’s other people way better than me already.”
This sense of uncertainty is normal for anyone learning a new skill.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone!
After reading part one of this article, you are probably wondering how you can get started as an entrepreneur.
Though I am still young and learning, I believe there is four key steps you can take to get started:
Step One: Find something you like
Before diving into trying to capitialise on your skills, figure out what you are good at! Whether it&amp;rsquo;s technology, art, food, music, socialising or fashion, find something you are passionate about and enjoy.</description>

      <title>Part One: Here is Why You Should Explore Entrepreneurship</title>

      <description>Youth is a springing blossom. It’s the perfect season of life to experience several of many firsts. First true friendships. First crush. First setback. First feeling of immense pressure as exams can creep up on you.
Entrepreneurship is commonly associated with money, exchanges of cash in the millions and talks of stocks and shares.
When in reality, being an entrepreneur really only entails two things. The most familiar to many is profit.</description>

      <title>Say YES!</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you just started saying yes to life and all the opportunities that come your way? I know after watching the Yes Man movie (I recommend it!) when I was little I thought the prospect of embracing every experience sounded fun and exciting… yet I really did not realise where it would lead me!
Somehow I became a person who seemingly did so many things and ended up loving meeting people and embracing new adventures.</description>

      <description>An 8-year-old me sat on a lacquered, hardwood floor staring intently at the books haphazardly lined along his family’s bookshelves. Amongst the cookbooks and Emily Bronte novels was stationed a book that captivated my attention “Creating Web Pages with HTML Simplified 2nd Edition&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; by Ruth Maran. I don’t know what about that book made me so transfixed, but, my curiosity was palpable.
I briefly scrutinized the cover and its contents before rushing into my parents’ room.</description>

      <description>It was January 2020. I had just returned from NCSS in Melbourne and had won a hackathon at the Academy of Entrepreneurs. The energy of the camps lingered on me and I was itching to do something, something big, exceptional and meaningful to me. Now, almost every bit of knowledge I have around programming came from online courses. When the topics were easy, I cruised through the tutorials, but when my code stopped working, it was truly frustrating to figure out what’s wrong.</description>

      <title>Code in School - Why Bother?</title>

      <description>I initially had no clue what to write about when starting this post.
So I figured I may as well think of why it is that I even like or got into programming in the first place.
The first thing that I realised that if it hadn’t been for the computer lab that was set up and a passionate temp teacher in primary school starting a makeshift coding club at lunchtimes, I probably never would have had an interest in computers or coding, never would have decided to continue teaching myself once she left the school, never would have paid attention in year 7 technology classes, and most likely would not have chosen IST as a year 9 elective.</description>

      <description>I first joined my schools F1 program in 2018 at the beginning of year 9. At the time I didn’t really know much the competition, and was only really joining to get an activity I could use for Duke of Ed. I already had a love for designing and making things and I thought making a mini race car sounded pretty cool. In my first year of competition I competed with a team called Quicksilver.</description>

      <description>The launch of the code club “Code Ninjas” founded by students Giuliana De Bellis and Edwina Adisusila in 2018 saw an exciting opportunity for extra-curricular computer programming at St Ursula’s College Kingsgrove.
Code Ninjas was first developed after Giuliana and Edwina attended the National Computer Science school in 2018. This camp inspired the girls to take their newfound passion and skills to the students at our school. Coming back from the camp, they brainstormed possible ways to get the college community involved in coding.</description>

      <description>My love for stem came from meeting one of my best friends, Tom Day, back in 2016. He got me into computer programming.
This opened a whole lot of doors in opportunities for me, such as attending my first academic camp hosted by the National Computer Science School in 2019. Through this, I found a love for all things STEM! This camp was honestly one of the best experiences of my life.</description>

      <title>Falling for Physics</title>

      <description>Throughout my early years of high school, I always intended to take either Biology or Chemistry as my science elective for the HSC. So when I wound up in a class studying Physics due to subject availability, I was not enthusiastic at all. I went in with many preconceptions about physics: that it was all about maths, that you needed to study engineering to understand the content, that my English-loving brain wouldn’t be able to comprehend anything&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Hey, everyone!
Developing Bits to Bytes has been a jam-packed journey for me over the past couple of months. The team and I have iterated over the idea several times, putting in hours of effort into bringing it to life.
Now as I type up this first post, I find myself teeming with excitement at the possibilities of what Bits to Bytes can grow into.
A strong passion for science, technology, engineering and maths has inspired me to come up with this idea.</description>
