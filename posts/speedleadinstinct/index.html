            <p><p>I first joined my schools F1 program in 2018 at the beginning of year 9. At the time I didn’t really know much the competition, and was only really joining to get an activity I could use for Duke of Ed. I already had a love for designing and making things and I thought making a mini race car sounded pretty cool. In my first year of competition I competed with a team called Quicksilver. I was the manufacturing engineer and it was safe to say we were pretty hopeless. We didn’t have a grasp of quite how massive the competition was, and the kind of effort required to really be successful. This was all highlighted at our first regional competition where our car didn’t even make it to the end of the track as the front wing was dragging on the tether guide. </p>
<p>After regionals we found out that another team from our school had been offered a wildcard entry to the state finals. Both myself and another good mate from Quicksilver, Christopher Tsolakis joined their team to compete. Having never been to a major F1 In Schools competition before, I wasn’t really sure what to expect arriving at state that year. Those 3 days were probably the highlight of my whole high school experience up to that point. The chance to meet and make friends with a whole room full of engineering nerds at once who understood that random words that often come out of my mouth was a novel experience. I also got a great understanding of just how big this small cocurricular activity I had signed up for, actually was. We watched the 2018 world finals video and it just really clicked how far this program could take me. We weren’t particularly successful that year, but we went home with a determination to come back stronger than ever and make through to at least nationals. </p>
<p>Only 2 weeks after we had returned from our first state final, myself and Chris (above mentioned) set about creating a new team. We pick a great designer who had previously competed in cadet class in year 9 as well as a resource manager from year 10 and a manufacturer from year 11. We were called Instinct Racing and our goal was solely to get to worlds. We worked harder than most ever had before. There were plenty of nights where we would be working solidly from 6pm to 2 in the morning. I hated that at the time, but when I look back now, they were some of the best times of the whole experience. It would just be 3 or 4 of us sitting on skype working generally in silence with the occasional word of advice given. We had plenty of great times in the lead up to regionals, highlights being getting our first sponsor (thank you Objective 3D, you guys are awesome), to running the Bunnings sausage sizzle at Ashfield and manufacturing an entire car in a single day starting at 6.30am starting the mill and finishing off the wheel assembly at 8pm that night with a whole day of classes in the middle, just so we could put our own car on the track at our school fair the next day (something we had only just decided to do the day before). The whole team became so close throughout the year, we got used to working very closely for hours on end. We got very good at communicating as well as pissing each other off at every opportunity. </p>
<p>My role in Instinct Racing was and Team and Marketing Manager. I was responsible for keeping the team on track. Making sure everyone was still working towards the same goal in addition to trying to get sponsors for the team and running all our social media. I had only previously been involved with manufacturing and designing the car, so this was a completely new experience for me but one I really did enjoy. We were very successful at the regional finals with Instinct Racing, we won 7 category awards and placed 1st overall. From there we got to compete at the state final. Once again there was a massive step up and we had to work incredibly hard all over again. In the end we ended up placing 3rd in Senior Professional class but did not receive a wildcard to nationals. This was very disappointing, but that does not diminish the amazing experience state was all over again. We made some amazing friends especially with teams Frontier Racing and Asphalt. We are still so close with these guys and we’ll treasure those memories for a long time. </p>
<p>I’ve stepped down from competing in 2020. I have moved into a role of leadership in my school’s F1 In Schools program where I can help mentor younger teams as they move through the competition. I may never have made it to worlds or even to nationals, but that’s not what I’m thinking about anymore. When I think about my memories as a competitor, I’m not remembering the award presentations, I’m thinking about the amazing friendships I made. I remember the nights where we’d still be working after school until 10pm at night. We hadn’t stopped since 3.30 that afternoon, we were all just there working in silence on different project elements with an occasional cry of success as a front wing was successfully attached to a car, or the final screw was put into the booth. These were awful and incredibly hard at the time, but now I long for just one more night like that with my mates.  I think about the incredible skills that I’ve gained and the opportunities I’ve had to engage with the industry. I have gotten so much out of this competition and it has without a doubt, changed my life forever. It is through this competition that I discovered my passion for engineering, it is because of this competition, that I had the opportunity to make connections with industry professionals who have been able to teach me so much.  </p>
<p>I’d like to say thank you to Dr Michael Myers and Andrew Denford who have made this competition what it is. Thank you to Deborah who just makes F1 run in Australia, to Bret and all the other REA staff that have help support us over the years. Of course, a massive thank you to my teacher Ms Lak and Evan Favos, you guys have been beside me every step of the way and never hesitate to support one of my crazy ideas. And to all the sponsors who have trusted that this crazily enthusiastic 16-year-old, with a passion for engineering might have some kind of potential. It has been an incredible experience and I can only hope that I will have more chances in the future to be involved with REA and F1 In Schools. </p>
