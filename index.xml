      <description>Hey, everyone!
Developing Bits to Bytes has been one heck of an intense journey for me over the past couple of months. My team and I have iterated over the idea several times and it is fair to say a lot of hard work has gone into this.
But what exactly is &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo;?
Without a doubt, I can confidently say I have a strong passion for science, technology, engineering and maths.</description>
